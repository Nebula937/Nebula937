Title: "The Night Will Never End"

Verse 1:
In a world so dark and eerie,
Where shadows dance and spirits roam,
There's a place where fear is buried,
A haunted pizzeria, it feels like home.

Chorus:
Welcome to Freddy's, a place where nightmares meet,
Animatronic creatures, their eyes glowing bright,
When the clock strikes midnight, their souls rise beneath,
The night will never end, beware the terror in the night.

Verse 2:
As the moonlight fades into oblivion,
The animatronics come alive,
Their metal frames, a twisted symphony,
In this nightmare, we strive to survive.

Chorus:
Welcome to Freddy's, a place where nightmares meet,
Animatronic creatures, their eyes glowing bright,
When the clock strikes midnight, their souls rise beneath,
The night will never end, beware the terror in the night.

Bridge:
We're trapped within these walls of dread,
Every corner hides a dreadful surprise,
Haunted by the memories of the departed,
Can we escape or will we meet our demise?

Verse 3:
A carousel of horrors spinning round,
Walking through the halls, with hearts pounding fast,
We must solve the mystery that lies unbound,
Before our souls are forever trapped in the past.

Chorus:
Welcome to Freddy's, a place where nightmares meet,
Animatronic creatures, their eyes glowing bright,
When the clock strikes midnight, their souls rise beneath,
The night will never end, beware the terror in the night.

Outro:
In this twisted world, a haunting melody,
Forever echoes in the depths of our souls,
But with courage, we'll break this curse, you'll see,
And put an end to the horrors that unfold.
